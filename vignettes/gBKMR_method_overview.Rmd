## Causal Estimands

We consider a setting in which $n$ subjects, labelled $i = 1, ..., n$,  enter a study at baseline (time $t=0$) and
are subjected to treatment $A_{0, i}$. In a clinical trial, the value of $A_{0, i}$ is determined by the study protocol,
usually at random. In an observational study, $A_{0, i}$ is  observed and recorded.
A collection of
covariates, $C_{0, i}$, are also measured at baseline. At the subsequent follow-up visits, the time-varying confounders, $L_{t, i}$
 and treatment $A_{t, i}$ are recorded, $t = 1, ..., T$. An outcome $Y_i$ is observed for each subject, measured at the final visit $T$, $Y_i$ can be continuous or binary. 

 Along with the \textit{observed outcome} $Y_i$ for each subject, for each possible realization of the treatment
history $\Bar{a} \in \Bar{\mathcal{A}}$; we also define $Y_i^{\Bar{a}}$, the \textit{potential outcome} that would have been observed had the subject, possibly contrary to fact, received treatment history $\Bar{a}$.

In a simple setting with 3 visits, assume the following DAG. Under the static, fixed treatment regimes,  the overall causal effect of the exposures changing form the $25^{th}$ percentile to the $75^{th}$ percentile can be defined as:

 
$$ACE = E[Y^{A_0 = a_0^*, A_1 = a_1^*, A_2 = a_2^*}] - E[Y^{A_0 = a_0, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2}]$$
where $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are the $25^{th}$ percentile of the exposures, $a_0^*, a_1^*, a_2^*$ are the $75^{th}$ percentile of the exposures.

## g-formula

The basic idea of g-formula is standardization, a common
approach to estimating the expected value of $Y^{\bar{a}}$ in the population. (Naimai, Ashley I., et al., 2017) It can be illustrated in a simple time-fixed confounding example where there are only baseline confounders $C_0$ where the sum is over all possible values $c_0$ of $C_0$. 
$$E\left(Y^{\bar{a}}\right)=\sum_{C_{0}  } E\left(Y \mid \bar{A}=\bar{a}, C_{0}=c_{0}\right) P\left(C_{0}=c_{0}\right)$$
where the sum is over all possible values $c_0$ of $C_0$.\\


Using the above DAG, we now define 3 identifying assumptions:\\

1. Consistency: 
$$E[Y | A_0 = a_0, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2] = E[Y^{a_0, a_1, a_2}| A_0 = a_0, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2]$$ 

2. Exchangeability:  
    \begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item $Y^{a_0, a_1, a_2} \indep  A_0 | C_0$
    \item $Y^{a_0, a_1, a_2} \indep  A_1 | C_0, A_0, L_1$
    \item $Y^{a_0, a_1, a_2} \indep  A_2 | C_0, A_0, L_1, A_1, L_2$ 
    \end{itemize} 

3. Positivity:
$$Pr(a_t|a_{t-1}, l_t, c_0) > 0 \ \text{for all values of} \ l \  \text{with} \  Pr(L = l) \ne 0 $$


The general expression of the g-formula for a static fixed intervention is:
$$\begin{equation}
E[Y^{\bar{a}}]= \sum_{\bar{l}} \mathrm{E}[Y \mid \bar{A}=\bar{a}, \bar{L}=\bar{l}, C_0 = c_0] \prod_{t=0}^{T} f\left(l_{t} \mid \bar{a}_{t-1}, \bar{l}_{t-1} \right)f(c_0) 
\end{equation}]
$$

##  Bayesian kernel machine regression

We first review Kernel Machine Regression (KMR) as a framework for estimating the effect of a complex mixture when only a single time point of exposure is measured. For each subject $i = 1, ..., n$, we assume

$$\begin{equation}
    Y_{i}=h\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)+\mathbf{c}_{i}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\beta}+\epsilon_{i}
\end{equation}$$
 where $\mathbf{a}_{i}=\left(a_{i 1}, \ldots, a_{i M}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ is a vector of $M$ exposure variables. 
 
It can be shown that the above model can be expressed as the mixed model 
$$y_{i} \sim N\left(h_{i}+\mathbf{c}_{i}^{T} \boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^{2}\right)$$  

$$\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h} \equiv\left(h_{1}, \ldots, h_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}} \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \tau \mathbf{K})    
\end{equation}$$ 

where $\mathbf{K}$ is the kernel matrix, has $(i, j)-$element $K(\mathbf{a}_{i}, \mathbf{a}_{j})$ 


There are different choices of the kernel. We focus on the Gaussian kernel, which flexibly captures a wide range of underlying functional forms for $h(\cdot)$, although the methods are applicable to a broad choice of kernels. 
We assume $$\operatorname{cor}\left(h_{i}, h_{j}\right)=\exp \left\{-(1 / \rho) \sum_{m=1}^{M}\left(a_{i m}-a_{j m}\right)^{2}\right\}$$
where $\rho$ is a tuning parameter that regulates the smoothness of the dose-response function. This assumption implies that two subjects with similar exposures   will have more similar
risks ($a_i$  to $a_j$, and $h_i$ will be close to $h_j$ ).

[Bobb et al (2015)](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/16/3/493/269719) presented the Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) as a framework to estimate the effect of a complex mixture on a health outcome. 

To fit (2), we assume a at prior on the coefficients for the confounding variables, $\beta \sim 1$, and  
 $\sigma^{-2} \sim \operatorname{Gamma}\left(a_{\sigma}, b_{\sigma}\right)$, where we set $a_{\sigma} = b_{\sigma} = 0.001$. 
 
We can parameterize BKMR by $\lambda=\tau \sigma^{-2}$, and we assume a Gamma prior distribution for the variance component of $\lambda$. 
For the smoothness parameter $\rho$, we assume $\rho \sim \operatorname{Unif}(a, b)$ with $a=0$ and $b=100$. For additional details regarding BKMR and prior specifications, see Bobb et al. (Bobb et al., [2015](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/16/3/493/269719), [2018](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0413-y))
