Description: Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) is becoming a popular approach for studying the joint effect of environmental mixtures on health outcomes allowing for variable selection, which is particularly useful when continuous exposures display moderate correlations. An R package, bkmr, has been developed to implement this method. BKMR-causal mediation analysis (BKMR-CMA) has been proposed to estimate direct and indirect effects of mixtures through a hypothesized mediator.
